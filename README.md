- ðŸ”­ I currently am working on no new projects - but that will change once our class works on new projects and I learn the ways around Github and VS Code.<br><br>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work my way around GitHub, VS Code, and the ways of code. It's been quite the learning process - but practice makes progress.<br><br>
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to get more efficient in GitHub and how to learn the shortcuts in a quick and effective way, so I'm not spending extra time typing out tons of code. <br><br>
